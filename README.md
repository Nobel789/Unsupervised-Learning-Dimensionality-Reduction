# Unsupervised-Learning-Dimensionality-Reduction

Unsupervised Learning: Clustering & Dimensionality ReductionThis repository explores techniques for discovering hidden patterns in unlabeled datasets. It contrasts rigid clustering methods (K-Means) with flexible density-based methods (DBSCAN) and visualizes high-dimensional results.🧠 Algorithms Implemented1. Clustering TechniquesK-Means: Implemented customer segmentation based on Annual Income and Spending Score. Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters ($k=4$).DBSCAN: Compared against K-Means to demonstrate its superiority in handling noise (outliers) and non-spherical cluster shapes.2. Dimensionality ReductionPCA (Principal Component Analysis): Reduced data dimensions linearly to visualize variance.t-SNE: Applied non-linear reduction to reveal local structures, showing distinct clusters that PCA missed.🛠️ Libraries UsedScikit-Learn: KMeans, DBSCAN, PCA, TSNE.StandardScaler: Crucial for distance-based algorithms like K-Means to normalize features.Matplotlib: For scatter plots of clusters.
